Portal styled game based of math question and answering method. 2 player game winner is the one with the highest total at the end.
First person styled. Where a math question is is Diplayed to user. User must walk into the correct portal to advance to different levels.
Currently set on 10 levels. each level progresses with difficulty.
If player enters wrong portal health deteriorates faster --> an alien or another creature pops out of the portal and attacks you, decreasing your health

There will be 3 portals in total, a "machine" will present the question to the player as well as the choice of changing the current question.
the "machine" will have a battery containing 3 charges. every time you change a question, you use all three charges. to recharge the question flip mechanism, you're gonna need to answer a question correctly. for every correct question a single charge is rewarded.
(thus a total of 3 correct answers must be made to replenish the battery) The scenery will be based on exotic outdoor locations on alien 
planets. Rikesh can go hog wild on design here.
